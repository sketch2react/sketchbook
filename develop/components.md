# Components ðŸ’Ž

## **Grid & Layout Components**

These are for setting up grids and layouts in Sketch. You create all of them in Sketch **by creating Groups \(âŒ˜G\) and renaming the groups accordingly.**

### **{Container}**

```text
{Container}
```

Creates a Bootstrap Container element. This is the outermost element in a Bootstrap grid. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You can also have {Container} elements inside of {Col} elements \(known as nesting\).
{% endhint %}

**Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]
> * Backgrounds {Background}

**Since:** v0.4.4

{% hint style="success" %}
#### How to add in Sketch:

1. Create a text node **\(T\)**
2. Group that text node **\(âŒ˜+G\)**
3. Rename group **{Container}**
4. Delete text node _or_ name it {text} 
{% endhint %}

### **{Container-fluid}**

```text
{Container-fluid}
```

Creates a Bootstrap Container-fluid element. This element \(as opposed to {container}\) always covers 100% of the available width \(screensize or, if nested, the width of the parent {col} element\)

#### **Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]
> * Backgrounds {Background}

**Since:** v0.4.4

{% hint style="success" %}
#### How to add in Sketch:

1. Create a text node **\(T\)**
2. Group that text node **\(âŒ˜+G\)**
3. Rename group **{Container-fluid}**
4. Delete text node _or_ name it {text} 
{% endhint %}

### **{Row}**

```text
{Row}
```

Creates a Bootstrap Row element. A {row} is a direct child to {container} or {container-fluid}. This element's height is always at least as high as the corresponding element in the Sketch document.

#### **Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]
> * Backgrounds {Background}

**Since:** v0.4.4

{% hint style="info" %}
#### **Pro tip!** 

By adding the Bootstrap 4 class _no-gutters_ you will remove gutters from child {col}. 

Example:

#### {Row} \[no-gutters\]
{% endhint %}

**Since:** v0.4.4

{% hint style="success" %}
#### How to add in Sketch:

1. Create a text node **\(T\)**
2. Group that text node **\(âŒ˜+G\)**
3. Rename group **{Row}**
4. Delete text node _or_ name it {text} 
{% endhint %}

### **{Col}**

```text
{Col}
```

Creates a Bootstrap Col element. A {col} is a direct child to {row}. {col} can contain {container} or {container-fluid} elements \(Known as nesting\). It is within this element you place all your content.

#### **Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]
> * Backgrounds {Background}

**Since:** v0.4.4

{% hint style="success" %}
#### How to add in Sketch:

1. Create a text node **\(T\)**
2. Group that text node **\(âŒ˜+G\)**
3. Rename group **{Col}**
4. Delete text node _or_ name it {text} 
{% endhint %}

### **{Group}**

```text
{Group} 
```

This is a structural component used as a helper to align itâ€™s child-elements \(vertically or horizontally\). It supports classes, but not Sketch-styling.

#### Horizontally:

If you, within a {group} place X number of Stratos elements next to each other horizontally, {Group} will make sure they end up horizontally in code. They will also be automatically centered vertically.

The remaining space \(the difference/delta between the child-elements total width and the {Group}â€™s own width\) will be distributed evenly **between** the children.

#### Vertically:

If you, within a {Group} place X number of Stratos elements stacked vertically in Sketch, {Group} will make sure they end up vertically in code. 

The remaining space \(the difference/delta between the child-elements total height and the {Group}â€™s own height\) will be distributed evenly **between** the children. 

**Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]

**Since:** v0.4.4

### {Group-fixed}

```text
{Group-fixed}
```

This element is identical to {Group} except that it always keeps the same width \(taken from Sketch\) even when you resize itâ€™s parent component \(e.g. a {Col}\). 

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note!** {Group-fixed} is never wider that the size of it's parent element. 
{% endhint %}

**Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]

**Since:** v0.4.4

### {Div}

A generic component well suited for implementing things such as other grid systems \(e.g. [MaterialUI grid](https://www.muicss.com/)\) or construct your own components!

**Since:** v0.4.4

## Design Components

These are for common design tasks such as texts, images & backgrounds. You create all of them in Sketch **by using the Shape Tools.** 

### **SVG's**

Any graphic, illustration, icon or UI element that you have inside your design tool can be converted to SVG with a few very simple steps.

1. **Group your vector shape layers** and call it something great
2. With the group selected go to the **Inspector panel** in Sketch and press **Make Exportable**
3. Choose **SVG**
4. You may need to **reload inside our Stratos app** for it to show up, use our reload button on the right corner of the design view \(the actual HTML view of your live Sketch file\)

### **{Text}**

```text
{Text}
```

The text-layers created in Sketch needs to be named {text} in order for the previewer app to find them and parse them properly. By default {text} generates an HTML paragraph tag.

You can set which kind of HTML element should be created by specifying e.g. _{text.span}_. Available types are:

**{text.p}** \(same as default {text}\) - This creates an HTML paragraph tag

```text
{text.p}
```

**{text.span}** - This creates an HTML span tag

```text
{text.span}
```

**Supports:** Text styles

### **{image}**

```text
{image}
```

Creates an image with a responsive size. It scales according to available width.

**Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]

**Since:** v0.0.5

{% hint style="success" %}
**ProTip!** Make sure to export/reimport your assets at the @2x resolution so that you don't get fuzzy edges on retina resolution screens.
{% endhint %}

### **{image-fixed}**

```text
{image-fixed}
```

Creates an image with fixed width and height \(taken from Sketch\).

**Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]

**Since:** v0.0.5

### {rectangle}

![The {rectangle} component is perfect for quick wireframing](../.gitbook/assets/wireframes.gif)

```text
{rectangle}
```

Creates a HTML-div element that is 100% of it's parent elements height and 100% width of it's parent element. This element's height is always at least as high as the corresponding element in the Sketch document.

{% hint style="info" %}
By adding the Bootstrap class \[rounded-circle\] to the {rectangle} you'll get a rounded circle.
{% endhint %}

```text
{rectangle} [rounded-circle]
```

This is a Sketch "Rectangle"-Shape

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pro tip!** This is an awesome way to create responsive wireframes ðŸŽ‰
{% endhint %}

### **{BG}**

```text
{BG}
```

Can be a rectangle or an image. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro tip!** Fill the {BG} with a nice linear gradient for really nice website backgrounds that are super lightweight in size. Use {container-fluid} and put the {BG} like below:
{% endhint %}

### Fluid fonts

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pro tip!** By adding the class _js-font-fluid-12_ you will have fluid font-size. The last part \(12\) refers to the number of px the font will span between. This is also dependent of the artboart size.
{% endhint %}

#### First example

* You have a mobile-size artboard \(576px wide\).
* You have a {text} with font-size 18px.
* You have a {text} with the class _js-font-fluid-10_ 

```text
{Text} [js-font-fluid-10]
```

The font-size will then flow between 18px at the smallest screen-size and 28px at the largest screen-size.

#### **Second example**

* You have a desktop-size artboard \(&gt;576px wide\).
* You have a {text} with front-size 18px.
* You have a {text} with the class _js-font-fluid-12_

```text
{Text} [js-font-fluid-12]
```

The font-size will then flow between 6px at the smallest screen-size and 18px at the largest screen-size.

**Supports:**

> * classes \[ \]
