## Why can't I install your code app?

All Mac apps that are not certified by Apple that you download from the web or distribute privately \(via your own channels\) give you a warning the very first time you open them. 

Just chill and do like below and happiness will \(maybe\) come to you.

1. Go to **System Preferences**
2. Click on **Security & Privacy**
3. It will contain a message that says "Sketch2React Code App was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer"
4. Click on **Open Anyway**

You been good, now go celebrate this with a great cup of the very best company coffee you can find ‚òï
