# Code App 👩‍💻

{% hint style="info" %}
Current version of our Mac Desktop Code App is **v.0.6.3**
{% endhint %}

## Sketch2React Code App features

* **Hot Reload** - Every time you save in Sketch it automatically reloads that file in our code app
* **Offline Mode** - Everything that does not require an internet connection in your design file will work offline
* **Mobile View** = Opens up another responsive window of your design with the start width of 576px
* It’s super fast 
* Use **CSS plugins**
* Handy shortcuts to our documentation & tutorials \(requires internet connection to work\)

## How to use

1. Go to **File---&gt;Open \(⌘O\)** 
2. **Open up the .sketchfile** you are working on
3. That same file is now linked with our **Code App** 
4. Happy makings!

## How to download HTML5

1. Go to the **Side Bar** in our app and click **Add to Export**
2. Do this for each artboard you want exported to HTML5
3. Go to **Download** and choose where to save
4. You know have a **.zip file** with all of your files, assets neatly organized in separate folders

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have set everything up correctly inside of Sketch, the only thing you need to do now is drag all of these files onto your own server and your done! 💥
{% endhint %}

## **Handy shortcuts**

**⌘O** = Link to your .sketchfile

**⌥⌘M** = Mobile View, opens up a new responsive window with start width 576px

**⌘D** = Documentation

**⌘T** = Tutorials

**⌘F** = Demo files

**⌘P** = Publications on our blog

## Why can't I install your code app?

All Mac apps that are not certified by Apple that you download from the web or distribute privately \(via your own channels\) give you a warning the very first time you open them. 

Just chill and do like below and happiness will \(maybe\) come to you.

1. Go to **System Preferences**
2. Click on **Security & Privacy**
3. It will contain a message that says "Sketch2React Code App was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer"
4. Click on **Open Anyway**

You been good, now go celebrate this with a great cup of the very best company coffee you can find ☕
