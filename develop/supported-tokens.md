# Supported Tokens \(WIP\)

## A couple of rules to follow

There are **five design rules** that you **need to follow.**

1. The structure of nested Groups in the design document defines the structure of the output JSON data
2. Rectangles represent a color value based of the rectangle’s fill value
3. Text layers represent text formatting
4. Text layers with values within _**{ }**_ are evaluated
5. Text layers with values within _**{ }**_ and matches a CSS property will have only that CSS property’s value \(as opposed to plain Text layers which will contain all CSS properties; see bullet 3 above\)
