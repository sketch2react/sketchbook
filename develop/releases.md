## 0.5.1 - 2020-03-20

### Added:

* Style Dictionary integration to support export to web, mobile and desktop
* Support for Figma
* Support for InVision Studio
* Support for variables in text nodes **{**color.base.primary.value**}** \(specified as **{{**color.base.primary.value**}}**\) in your design tool. This is used to reuse values in Style Dictionary
* New menu item “File &gt; Open project in Terminal”
* Artboards can now be named anything and will still be considered as “Token artboards”. Previously only artboards named “Template” were considered for design token generation. \(You still need an artboard named _**Start**_\)
