#### 👉 🌋 Support for Sketch Cloud Documents

Eager to use [Sketch for Teams](https://www.sketch.com/teams/) and all those new fancy ways of working together? Guess what, as of version 1.6 we now have support for working directly with Sketch Cloud Documents.

#### 👉 🌋 Support for Sketch Shared Libraries

You can now build up your real code component library and share it with anyone that uses Sketch. It’s as easy as 1–2–3. To get you kick-started we have included our own S2RSharedLib ⭐

#### ⚙️ 👉 👩‍💻 New component [{link}](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/components#link-symbol)

Link any element to anything! Like images or texts!

#### ⚙️ 👉 👩‍💻 New component[ {div}](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/components#div)

A generic component well suited for implementing things such as other **grid systems** \(e.g. MaterialUI grid\) or construct your own components!

#### ⚙️ 👉 👩‍💻 New component [{externalasset.js}](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/components#5084)

It is now possible to add your own javascript-files to your HTML-exports. This adds a new dimension of interactivity to your HTML-exports!

#### 👉 🤖 CSS-modules

Our React export now utilizes CSS-modules. This means the dependency on Sketch2React’s package \(@sketch2react/react-components\) is gone! **No dependency on us once your React code is exported!** 🥳

#### 👉 🤖 Updated React export’s dependencies

We’ve updated the React export’s dependencies to remove package vulnerabilities.

You no longer get warnings about “unused variables” in the console because, guess what, there are none! 💪
