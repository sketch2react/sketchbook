  Stratos Tokens is a very powerful way of working directly from your design
  application with design tokens and themes.

# How it works üß∞

![](../../.gitbook/assets/tokens2021workflow.png)

**TLDR;** _Stratos Tokens App_ reads the **raw design file** \(no plugins\) and **generates a design token file** \(JSON-format\). This file can then be either stored directly in your codebase or uploaded to repositories like _NPMjs_ to be consumed by any codebase on any platform. And it‚Äôs **1:1 with your design file!**

You visually represent your **Design Tokens** in a design tool, [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) are currently supported and we have macOS and Windows versions of our app.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/tokens-2021-sketch.png)

The **Stratos Tokens App** __reads your design file \(without plugins, yupp, just like that\) and generates a file with a JSON structure containing your design data. Then you either save the design data file \(Design Tokens\) or upload it to a repository like _NPMjs_.

{% hint style="success" %}
The structure of the output JSON is a direct reflection of the structure in your design document.

ü§ñüëâ _**It‚Äôs up to you to create your own structure.**_
{% endhint %}

Please note that above is just an **example** of how to structure your design tokens & theming. It‚Äôs up to you to create your own structure.

## How to create design tokens

Basically you use **shapes, lines, layer groups & text nodes** to output design token data. Here's a few great things to know ü§ñüëá

1. Design token names must be wrapped in **{ }** ‚Äì including your **design token artboards**
2. The structure of nested Groups \(Sidebar = Sketch, Layers Panel = Figma\) in the design document defines the structure of the output JSON data
3. **Rectangles** represent a **color value** based of the rectangle‚Äôs fill value
4. Rectangles without a fill results in **border formatting**
5. **Lines represent width,** perfect for defining **breakpoints**, **spacing & padding**
6. Text layers represent **text formatting**
7. **Text layers with values within { }** are evaluated. Perfect for defining things like **font families, transitions & animation timing**
8. Text nodes with values within **{{ }}** are considered as Style Dictionary references / variables to be able to reuse values. 
9. Text layers with names that matches a CSS property will have only that CSS property‚Äôs value \(as opposed to plain Text layers which will contain all CSS properties; see bullet 6 above\)

## What do I do next?

Easiest way to get started with a blank Stratos Tokens project is

### For Sketch

1. Start **Sketch app** and **Create a New document**
2. Create **one artboard**, the size does not matter
3. Give your artboard a simple name, **lower case only, no blank spaces between words** e.g {great-artboard-name}
4. Save your Sketch file to your HD
5. Drag and drop that Sketch file onto our app like in the video below 
6. You are now ready to start creating design tokens straight from inside Sketch app

You click on the _file explorer_ and select the artboard named _Light._

This design data structure is now available from **three places**:

* Direct copy/paste
* As a stand-alone file in the project‚Äôs _data_ folder.
* Downloadable as _NPM-project_

## NPM project? Oooh, tell me more‚Ä¶

Ok, sure. There are a few steps, but stay with us, it‚Äôs worth it. In the example below our new **design tokens NPM package** is named _stratos-designtokens-demo_. You can name yours whatever you like.üëçüòÑ

If you don‚Äôt have the time/patience to read through all the steps; here‚Äôs the final example package install command:

```text
npm install ‚Äî save stratos-designtokens-demo
```

![It&#x2019;s a big button, you can&#x2019;t miss it. &#x1F63A;&#x1F44D;](../../.gitbook/assets/ska-rmklipp-2020-04-28-09.39.41.png)

### Downloading

1. On the _Download_ tab in _Stratos Tokens App_, expand the _Design tokens NPM project_ and hit the _Download NPM_ button
2. Store the project anywhere you like

![Your downloaded NPM project&#x2019;s package.json](../../.gitbook/assets/1-qehtjbacmtze_rxvh8hmmg.png)

### Naming your NPM project

1. Open the file _package.json_ in your **downloaded NPM project‚Äôs folder** using your favorite code editor
2. Enter a name on line 2 \(this will be the name of the NPM package\)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/1-x30-64xmlugmx23odwc_ja.png)

### Uploading & publishing

1. Open _Terminal App_
2. Go to your **downloaded NPM project‚Äôs folder** \(we named ours _npmDTDemo_\)
3. If this is your _first time uploading a package_ to _NPMjs_ you need to _login_
4. Enter _npm login_ and enter your credentials \(you need an account at [www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)\)
5. Enter _npm install_ \(a bunch of texts will flash by, no worries, this is ok\)
6. Enter _npm run build_ \(more text will flash by, this is also ok\)
7. Enter _npm publish_ \(even more ok text\)

Your design tokens are now available for any codebase on any platform! And **it‚Äôs 1:1 with your Design tool‚Äôs design document!**

**Feel free to download and test the design tokens example here:**

```text
npm install --save stratos-designtokens-demo
```

#### React

![](../../.gitbook/assets/1-lhpat6rkwo6xtly2zg0rua.png)

You can of course use this for other frameworks and platforms as well  \(i.e. React native, Vue.js, Angular...\). And with a little help from our built-in Style Dictionary support you can also use your tokens for Android, Swift‚Ä¶ ****ü§ñüí™
