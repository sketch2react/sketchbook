## What is Sketch2React?

Sketch2React is a **free Design to Code Component framework** that consists of:

* A free framework based on **Bootstrap 4** that consists of [**Components**](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/components)\*\*\*\*
* A [**Desktop App**](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/code-app) ****\(Mac only\) that converts your Sketch files into actual code
* A **Sketch plugin** that helps you setting up the Bootstrap Grid inside of Sketch
* From our Code App you can **export to code components**

## What can it do?

Our framework is really great for many things, like for example:

* Design and **style your own components** like text, buttons, form fields, navigation
* You go from **design to code components** without ever leaving Sketch
* **React Vanilla or our version?** The choice is yours‚Ä¶
* Since we run Bootstrap 4 in the background you can **design and export real code grids** to your developers
* Add custom made **CSS animations**, overrides and effects as easy as [**1-2-3**](https://medium.com/sketch2react/css-animations-inside-of-sketch-with-sketch2react-d5d248633ac0)
* A great way to get started learning our framework is to use it for what we call [**Quick Responsive Prototyping**](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/how-to-use-sketch2react-for-quick-responsive-prototyping-cf02bce4e5b0)
* Since you're working with **real code** you get real code constraints, which is a great thing
* Pump out **Bootstrap 4 powered websites** for free like there's no tomorrow.  [Connect external CMS](https://twitter.com/Sketch2R/status/1095970041936429056) for even more awesomeness.

## What is the .sketchplugin for?

You actually don‚Äôt need the plugin but it can make your workflow faster. It works a bit like a wizard that helps you with all of the really tedious stuff like creating containers, choosing margin and paddings etc. All of these settings can be changed afterwards in Sketchs layer panel.

## Can I use web fonts like Google Fonts?

Yes you can! Actually it‚Äôs really easy, check out our handy [Cheat Sheet](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/~/edit/drafts/-LLAM2hl82xAVmvUkC0F/faq) for further instructions.

## How do I export to code?

You use our [Code App](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/~/edit/drafts/-LWFdY0D2JIlwF8q6ksG/develop/code-app) for that. Read more[ here about exporting](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/exporting-to-code).

## Does it cost money?

Framework, code app, layout plugin and HTML5 export will forever be free. We just released **RC1 of Sketch2React** and right now you can try out all of our Pro features \(React export, Public Preview etc\) totally for free. 

## Known issues

* **Microsoft One Drive** seems to have issues with our code app, somehow the Sketch-file doesn't load properly. Use Dropbox or iCloud Drive, they both work great. Or just have your design file locally on your computer, that always work üëç
