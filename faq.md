# FAQ 🤓

## What is Sketch2React?

Sketch2React is a **free design to code framework** that consists of:

* A free framework based on **Bootstrap 4** that consists of [**Components**](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/components)\*\*\*\*
* A [**Desktop App**](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/code-app) ****\(Mac only\) that converts your Sketch files into actual code
* A **Sketch plugin** that helps you setting up the Bootstrap Grid inside of Sketch

## When use our framework?

Our framework is really great for many things like for example:

* Static websites like for example portfolios, landing pages, product pages
* Advanced prototypes that you need to be real code

## When should I not use your framework?

All things that require complex logic that we don't yet support. On the other hand, designers can set up things like the grid, colors, fonts, general layout rules and with that developers can do anything. Sky is the limit!

## Do I upload my .sketchfile somehow to your web app?

Nope! Everything is handled locally on your computer, nothing gets uploaded to our servers. Super safe. We promise.

## What is the .sketchplugin for?

You actually don’t need the plugin but it will make your workflow so much faster. It works a bit like a wizard that helps you with all of the really tedious stuff like creating containers, choosing margin and paddings etc. All of these settings can be changed afterwards in Sketchs layer panel.

## Can I use web fonts like Google Fonts?

Yes you can! Actually it’s really easy, check out our handy [Cheat Sheet](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/~/edit/drafts/-LLAM2hl82xAVmvUkC0F/faq) for further instructions.

## How do I export to HMTL?

You use our [Code App](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/~/edit/drafts/-LWFdY0D2JIlwF8q6ksG/develop/code-app) for that. 

## Does it cost money?

During our private beta, no. Everything you create with it will forever be free. Read more [here](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/~/edit/drafts/-LWFdY0D2JIlwF8q6ksG/pricing).

## How stable is the Beta?

**It's really stable.** We call it Beta because we have not reached our goal yet. Not because it's flawed or super buggy. You can read an [article here](http://bit.ly/2y0iMBt) if you’re interested.
