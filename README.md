## What is Sketch2React?

****[**Sketch2React**](https://sketch2react.io) is a companion app that lets you **build React & HTML powered prototypes (and simple websites) **directly from inside Sketch or Lunacy 💎

> That gives you high fidelity code right from scratch 💪

* Design with **markup that's easy to learn!** It's more like [**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)****
* Fully responsive
* Zero plugins
* Treat the layers view in Sketch or Lunacy as a very simple **code editor**
* Use CSS plugins
* Offline mode
* Hot reload
* Build entire static React powered websites directly from inside of Sketch 🤯
* **N E W** 👉 Export directly to [Capacitor.js](https://capacitorjs.com) projects – Build cross platform apps, start inside Sketch 💪
* Export to HTML package that includes .html, css and all relevant files
* React code & components
