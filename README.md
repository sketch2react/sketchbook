## What can I do with Stratos Tokens 2021?

![Figma support coming later Q2 2021](.gitbook/assets/stratos-tokens-presentation-2020-shorter.001.jpeg)

* Use Sketch \(and soon also Figma\) to create, update and distribute your **design tokens & theming code**
* A single place to create and edit your styles
* Reads the raw design file \(Sketch\) and generates a JSON-structure based on your design data \(design tokens\)
* You can use **any setup you want**, you have 100% control over your design token & theming structure
* Use [Stratos Tokens](https://marketplace.sketch2react.io/product/stratos-tokens-pre-release/) app to output your code
* Supports Sketch files natively, no plugins are needed
* Support for **Sketch Shared Libraries** & **Sketch Symbols** - manage several brands remotely for your clients
* Export to NPM
* Export to iOS, Android, CSS via our built-in [Style Dictionary support](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/)\*

{% hint style="warning" %}
\*_Requires you to_[ _structure your design tokens_](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/properties?id=examples) _in your design application as Style Dictonary needs them to be or the export will not work_
{% endhint %}
