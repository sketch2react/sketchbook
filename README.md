Go from design file to code really fast!

### Marcode is:

* Markup to code companion app
* Automatic generation of CSS & CSS Modules
* Automatic HTML generation
* Export directly to iOS & Android **** with built-in Capacitor.js export
{% endhint %}

## What is Marcode?

Marcode is a **companion app for Sketch and Icons8 Lunacy** that reads the .sketch file in real time and outputs autogenerated code. No plugins needed, all is done using easy to learn markup on layers & groups.

> It's like having an extra layer of code, but straight inside your preferred design app 💪



* Design with markup that's easy to learn!&#x20;
* Fully responsive
* Zero plugins
* Treat the layers view in Sketch & Lunacy as a very simple **code editor**
* Use CSS plugins
* Offline mode
* Hot reload
* Build entire static websites directly from inside of Sketch 🤯
* Exports directly to [Capacitor.js](https://capacitorjs.com) projects – Build cross platform apps 💪
* Exports to HTML bundle that includes .html, css and all relevant files

{% hint style="success" %}
Also download our [Sketch Assistant](https://www.sketch.com/extensions/assistants/@sketch2react/sketch2react-assistant/), it's 100% compatible with Marcode
{% endhint %}
