## What is Stratos?

**Stratos** is a tool and framework that lets you **build React powered components** & websites ****directly from inside Sketch 💎 \(and Figma approx spring 2020\) 🤖

> That gives you high fidelity code right from scratch, in real-time, no plugins needed 💪

* Design with the **built-in tools in Sketch**

* Create **custom React components** within our code app
* Export **styled components** to React
* Export to **NPM**
* Export to React website project & HTML5 website project
* Fully responsive
* Zero plugins
* Visual way of learning more about code
* Treat the layers view in Sketch as a very simple **code editor**
* Use CSS plugins
* Offline mode
* Hot reload means real-time code previews

## Software requirements
