# Welcome to Marcode Docs 🏡

## Build in design app, deploy to code

![](.gitbook/assets/Marcode-MoneyShot.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
Go from design file to code really fast!

### Marcode is:

* **Markup,** [**code app**](https://marketplace.sketch2react.io/product/sketch2react/)
* **Automatic generation of CSS & CSS Modules**
* **Website HTML project export**
* Export **directly to iOS & Android** with built-in[ Capacitor.js export](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/exporting-to-code#export-to-capacitor-js)
{% endhint %}

## What is Marcode?

Marcode is a **companion app for Sketch and Icons8 Lunacy** that reads the .sketch file in real time and outputs autogenerated code. No plugins needed, all is done using easy to learn markup on layers & groups.

> It's like having an extra layer of code, but straight inside your preferred design app 💪



* Design with markup that's easy to learn!&#x20;
* Fully responsive
* Zero plugins
* Treat the layers view in Sketch & Lunacy as a very simple **code editor**
* Use CSS plugins
* Offline mode
* Hot reload
* Build entire static websites directly from inside of Sketch 🤯
* Exports directly to [Capacitor.js](https://capacitorjs.com) projects – Build cross platform apps 💪
* Exports to HTML bundle that includes .html, css and all relevant files
