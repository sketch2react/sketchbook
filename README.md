* Export **directly to iOS & Android** with built-in[ Capacitor.js export](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/exporting-to-code#export-to-capacitor-js)
{% endhint %}

## What is Marcode?

Marcode is a **companion app for Sketch and Lunacy** that reads the .sketch file in real time and outputs autogenerated code. No plugins needed, all is done using easy to learn markup on layers & groups.

> That gives you high fidelity code right from scratch 💪

* Design with markup that's easy to learn!&#x20;
* Fully responsive
* Zero plugins
* Treat the layers view in Sketch & Lunacy as a very simple **code editor**
* Use CSS plugins
* Offline mode
* Hot reload
* Build entire static React powered websites directly from inside of Sketch 🤯
* Export directly to [Capacitor.js](https://capacitorjs.com) projects – Build cross platform apps, start inside Sketch 💪
* Export to HTML package that includes .html, css and all relevant files
