## What is Stratos?

**Stratos** is a tool and framework that lets you **build React powered components** & websites ****directly from inside Sketch 💎\(and Figma approx spring 2020\)

> That gives you high fidelity code right from scratch 💪

* Design with code snippets that're easy to learn! It's more like [**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)\*\*\*\*
* Fully responsive
* Zero plugins
* Visual way of learning more about code
* Treat the layers view in Sketch as a very simple **code editor**
* Use CSS plugins
* Offline mode
* Hot reload
* Build entire static React powered websites directly from inside of Sketch 🤯
* Export to HTML package that includes .html, css and all relevant files
* React code & components

## Software requirements

* Sketch 58-60
* Stratos App
