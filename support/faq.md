# FAQ‚ùì

## Q: Why doesn't my Sketch file load in Sketch2React?

_So this sucks of course_. Here's a few things you can check before throwing out your computer machine through the window \(we actually don't recommend you ever doing that\) ü§£

1. Which version of Sketch do you have? We support from v68‚Äì72.2
2. Which version of OSX do you have? We support Catalina + Big Sur
3. Are you using the very latest version of [Sketch2React](https://marketplace.sketch2react.io/product/sketch2react/)? We update it from time to time, make sure to download the latest from your marketplace account \(found under [API Downloads](https://marketplace.sketch2react.io/my-account/api-downloads/)\)
4. Are you sure you are using our [markdown rules](https://sketch2react.gitbook.io/sketch2react-io/develop/components) in Sketch? Make sure to download and install our free [Sketch assistant](https://www.sketch.com/extensions/assistants/@sketch2react/sketch2react-assistant/)
5. Have you activated your Sketch2React license?
6. If you use any cloud services \(Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive etc\) make sure you actually have the Sketch files downloaded locally on your computer machine
7. For troubleshooting make sure you use one of our [newer free demo files](https://marketplace.sketch2react.io/product/portfolio-website-template/), it can be that something is broken in older versions of them
