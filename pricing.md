## **What is Release Candidate 1?**

It’s **version 1 of Sketch2React**, so basically we’re not in beta anymore — woo-pi-doooo! 😸👍

Our first plan was that when we finally reached 1.0, we would implement some kind of paid subscription plan for our **Pro features.** We’re still are, but not right now. So you get to play around with everything, totally for free, until we release version 2 of Sketch2React. We do this not only because we are super great guys, but also because we want to:

* Let you guys play around with all of our code export options
* Give you time, the only resource we can freely give you right now, to learn this, and see how it fits to your current work environment
* Gather feedback on what to improve

## **What’s new in RC1?**

* Export to **HTML5, Vanilla React or React**
* **Public Preview** lets you start a temporary web server right from our app
* Pages now add themselves automagically to our export bundle after loading/visiting them once
* Register & unregister license from your computer

## **How long will this be free?**

As long as we haven’t released version 2, RC1 will be free, all bells and whistles. At the very least a couple of months.

## **System Requirements**

* Sketch 52+
* Mac OSX Mojave
* Code App version 0.7.2
* RC1 License Key \(you get that when signing up via [our website](https://sketch2react.io/)\).

## **How to activate your RC1 license**

1. Open our **Code App**
2. Go to **Sketch2React Code App** and choose **Registration…**
3. Enter the license key
4. Restart our Code App
5. Boom done! 💥
