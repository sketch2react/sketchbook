## **Support us by purchasing DLC**

![](.gitbook/assets/s2rdlc2.png)

Since our framework is free we are experimenting with different ways of supporting this project financially. A new way of supporting us is to purchase something that we call **Sketch2React DLC.** Basically it's a **super bundle** of all the things locked away on Patreon. 

[Sketch2React DLC\#2 is now available for purchase!](https://gum.co/s2rdlc2)

## **How much does it cost?**

**The version of Sketch2React that you can download via our website is free.** Zero bananas. Zero dollares zero pesetas. _**We will continue to offer our framework and code app for free as long as we can support it.**_ ****Speaking of support, you really should think about supporting us, we are now on Patreon and you can buy lovely bundles way before public release \(DLC\). 

## Patreon

Since Patreon is taxable income and we are not a company \(just two dudes doing great stuff together\) we have one for each of us.
