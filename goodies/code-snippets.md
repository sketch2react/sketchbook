## How to add custom CSS without [CSS Writer](https://code.sketch2react.io/plugins/)

### **1. Creating the file**

1. Copy the code to a **blank new text document**, we usually use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
2. You can use all of these snippets in the same document just don't forget when saving to add .css or .js to the name of the document e.g. _**mycustomcode.css**_ or _**mycustomcode.js**_
3. Use the class name e.g _**.link**_ and enter it like this \[link] on any of our components üëá

### 2. Linking to the external asset inside Sketch

1. Drag the newly created .css or .js file to the Macs Terminal app, you will need the correct file path for linking this inside Sketch
2. Copy the file entire file path to clipboard, it usually starts with _/Users/‚Ä¶_
3. In Sketch use the Text tool and copy the file path from clipboard into your artboard
4. Add _file://_ just before _/Users/etcetc_ ending up with _**file:///Users/etcetc‚Ä¶**_
5. In the Side Panel name the text layer **{externalasset.css}** or **{externalasset.js}**
6. Make sure to copy the text layer to all of the artboards using your custom code
7. You can add as many {externalasset} layers as you need

## CSS snippets

### Text Hover Animate Bottom Border

```css
 .link::after {
   content: '';
   display: block;
   width: 0;
   height: 8px;
   margin-top:5px;
   background: #0b76ff;
   transition: width .3s ease-out;
}
 .link:hover::after {
   width: 100%;
}
 a:link {
   text-decoration: none;
}
```

#### **What it does**

Creates a simple animated line under any component that uses our {link} component. Feel free to change the height, color animation or anything else.

### Flexbox Equal Heights

A great trick to balance your designs in code is to use equal heights on things such as column backgrounds etc. Here's a neat snippet using only css flexbox.

```css
.flexbox {
display: -ms-flexbox;
display: -webkit-flex;
display: flex;
overflow: hidden;
}cssc
```
